# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately through GitHub, not in a public issue:

**[Open a private security advisory](https://github.com/trustabl/agent-reliability-analyzer/security/advisories/new)**

That route is private between you and the maintainers until a fix ships. Please
do not open a public issue, a pull request, or a discussion for a suspected
vulnerability.

Useful things to include: the version (`trustabl --version`), the platform, the
smallest input that reproduces it, and what you expected instead. A proof of
concept is welcome but not required.

We aim to acknowledge a report within three working days, and to tell you
whether it is in scope within a week. If we accept it, we will keep you updated
through the advisory and credit you in the release notes unless you would rather
we did not.

## Supported versions

Fixes land on the latest release. There are no long-term support branches.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest release | Yes |
| Anything older | No — upgrade first |

## Scope

Trustabl is a local CLI. It reads source code, resolves detection rules from a
separate repository, and writes reports. There is no server, no hosted service,
and no account.

**In scope**

- Code execution, path traversal, or file writes outside the intended output
  paths, triggered by a scanned repository's contents
- Anything that causes the scanner to transmit source code off the machine
  during `trustabl scan`, which is meant to be fully local
- Attestation flaws: a tampered report that still verifies, a signature that
  passes when it should not, or identity checks that can be bypassed
- Rule resolution flaws: loading rules from an unintended source, or accepting a
  rules bundle that fails its signature or schema gate
- Credential handling in the CLI or the shipped CI integrations, including
  leaking a token into logs or process arguments

**Out of scope**

- **A missed finding or a false positive is a bug, not a vulnerability.** Open a
  normal issue. Detection coverage is documented in `COVERAGE.md`, including
  known gaps
- Vulnerabilities in a repository you scanned. Those belong to that repository
- Findings that require an attacker to already control the machine running the
  scan
- Reports produced only by an automated scanner, with no demonstrated impact

## Applying fixes uses your own key

`trustabl scan` never needs a network connection or an API key. `trustabl enrich
--apply` is opt-in and sends the flagged code region to the LLM provider whose
key you supply. That is a deliberate boundary rather than a defect, but if you
find `enrich` transmitting more than the region it reports, that is in scope.
