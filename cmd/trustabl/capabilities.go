language, detector category, applies_to value, and match predicate it can
evaluate.

This is the contract a rule pack is checked against. The agent-reliability-rules CI gate
uses each supported release's descriptor to decide, before a rule change merges,
whether a proposed rule would run, be skipped (forward-compatible), or hard-break
that release — so a rules change can never silently break a deployed binary.

The output is deterministic (sorted), suitable for committing or publishing as a
release asset.`,
